#   This is the example virtual currency config. You can use this file as a template for your own currency.
#   This currency will NOT load and is only here for example purposes.
#   The file name is the ID of the currency.
#   You can also create multiple folders within 'virtual-currencies' to group your currencies.
#
#   IMPORTANT: If you DELETE one file, the target currencies will
#              be deleted including all stored Data after server restart.
#
#   You can use legacy or hex colors in every line for visual text.
#   If you have any problems, join my discord server (https://discord.gg/t9vS3hgWf8)
